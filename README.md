This is the first Project of data analyst nanodegree program offered by Udacity.

### Explore_Weather_Trends_Udacity

This poject was completed as part of Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree course requirements. The goal is to create visualization and write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the big city to the local city(AGRA).

## Steps:-

Extract the data from the database using SQL provided in the Udacity portal.

Create a line chart for the data obtained.

Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world average temeprature with the local average temperature.

## Conclusion:-

The final analysis will take the form of a PDF document which contains a plot of the data,and outlines taken:
An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:

## Tools Used:

Python

SQL

Jupyter Notebook

##Submission:-

1.How to calcualte Moving Averages?

2.How to visualize the trends between local and global average temperatures?

3.Plot the chart with local and global temperature trends

4.Write up atleast four observations about the similarities and differences in the trends.
